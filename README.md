  <h1 align="Center">Bixby Facts Sample Capsule</h1>
</p>

## Overview

Do you have some interesting facts about a hobby or passion to share? Do you have a set of LOL jokes to share? The facts sample capsule is the perfect place to share that content by building a Bixby capsule.

Lots of the basic building blocks of a Bixby capsule are highlighted; This is a great capsule to start learning how to develop for Bixby.

You can easily customize this capsule with your own content without any development! Just use the spreadsheet in the `contentUtility` folder and cut and paste from there into the `content.js` file, update the `capsule.id` and `training` as necessary and you have made this capsule your own!

## How to get started

* Download and install the Bixby Studio IDE from the [Bixby Developer Center](http://bixbydevelopers.com)
* Download this capsule (zip is the easiest way) from Github. Unzip in your directory of choice
* Open the Capsule in Bixby Studio
* Open the simulator and give it a try!


## How to try
Ask about facts. Try these:

```
Tell me a fact (Bixby says a random fact)

Tell me a fact about dogs (Bixby says a fact about dogs)
```
Or ask about jokes. Try these:
```
Tell me a joke (Bixby says a random joke (fact)

Tell me a cat joke (Bixby says a random joke (fact) about cats)
```

## How to customize
* Put your own content (facts and associated tags and images) into `code/content.js` - You may also use the spreadsheet located in `contentUtility/CreateContent.xslx` to create content
* If you want to use images in your content you can either use a web URL or you can save your image under `assets/images` and refer to them with a relative path, e.g. `images/cow.png` (you might have to wait a little until the IDE uploads images to the cloud)
* Change the capsule id to reflect your organization and your content. The capsule id is defined in the `capsule.bxb` file
* You can customize the NoResult dialog (`resources/base/dialog/Content_NoResult.dialog.bxb`)
* Add more training / change the training
* Have fun!
